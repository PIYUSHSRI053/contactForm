## 🔁 Application Flow (How It Works)

1. User opens the contact form.
2. User enters required details (name, email, message, etc.).
3. JavaScript checks:
   - Are all fields filled?
   - Is the email format valid?
4. If validation fails:
   - Alert message is shown.
5. If validation passes:
   - Data is sent to the backend.
6. Backend processes the request.
7. User receives a success or error alert.

This flow ensures **data correctness** and **good user experience**.

## 🧪 Validation Logic Covered

- Required field enforcement
- Alert handling for user actions

These validations prevent:
- Blank submissions
